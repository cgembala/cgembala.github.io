    <p>Hannah and Marie met in middle school where they both played violin in the school orchestra. After years of friendship, they eventually parted ways to attend different colleges and pursue their interest in event coordinating. Upon finishing school, they helped plan each other's weddings, which lead them to create their own event planning enterprise. They both enjoy the opportunity to share their expertise with others in their community.</p>
